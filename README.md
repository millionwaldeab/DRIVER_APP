This is an Android Driver app. This app together with the passenger app will facilitate the process of connecting driver with 
passenger and transporting the passenger from point A to point B. This is the Driver app that is based on Google map. It displays
the driver's position in real time. As long as the driver stays on line, they will be available to any passenger app. When a 
passenger launch their app, they will see all available drivers around them. As soon as they make a request, the closest driver
receives the request in a form of alert box in the middle of the screen with an alarm ring tone. The driver will have an option 
either to accept or decline the request. 
If the driver accepts the request, then they will have the option to get navigation to the location of the passenger. At that 
time the passenger will get the real time location of the driver while the driver is navigating towards the pick up location. 
Both of them will have the option to cancel the request until the driver gets to the pick up location. If one of them cancels 
the request, the other will be notified immediately.
